# Surface Defect Detection

"Students will learn to apply a machine-learning algorithm to detect defects on object surfaces.
- The student can learn how to detect the ROI of images using various classification/segmentation algorithms.
- After detecting the ROI, students can investigate different classification algorithms to classify defect objects.
Notes:
- For better learning, it's good to investigate both complex and lightweight models for detection and classification 
- For easy project, pre-processed images in public dataset are enough
- Details of the project will be given in the discussion with supervisor"
